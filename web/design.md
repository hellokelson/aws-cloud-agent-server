1. I want use cloudscape to create a web portal for this agent(multi agent) running in main.py.
2. this web portal, have 2 parts: 
- left: conversation session list, each session have a item, the name would be the a title for the agent chat conversation session. this session can be bind to the agent session list. (actually in main.py defined session in s3, but have not yet have an api to retrive the session list, and retrive the session details. this apis should be created first.)
- right panel: have chat box on top. can ask any questions. can will invole the local running agentcore defined in main.py. by default have a new session created. if select existing session on left will use existing session to invoke the agent core. below the chat box should the chat response by running agentcore, the top should latest response, the below should the older items. 
- the response from agentcore should be formated, like the reasonning info and events and results the reasonning and events messages can collesped by default and the agentcore response results by default expanded. this should depends on the strands response docs to design or depends on real response result.
- but should call the agentcore according selected agent types, if DiagnosisAgent type should call @app.route("/DiagnosisAgent/invocations", methods=["POST"]) . if ResearchAgent type should @app.route("/ResearchAgent/invocations", methods=["POST"]). and so on..
